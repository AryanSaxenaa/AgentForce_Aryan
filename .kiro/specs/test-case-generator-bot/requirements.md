# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Test Case Generator Bot is an AI-powered developer agent that automatically analyzes user-submitted code in Python, Java, and JavaScript to generate comprehensive test suites. The system will intelligently detect edge conditions, performance risks, and provide coverage analysis while offering conversational refinement capabilities. The agent will interpret code flow and logic to create relevant unit, integration, and edge test cases, with optional CI/CD integration for automated test suggestions on pull requests.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to submit my code and receive automatically generated test cases, so that I can ensure comprehensive test coverage without manually writing all tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits Python, Java, or JavaScript code THEN the system SHALL parse and analyze the code structure
2. WHEN code analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate unit test cases covering all public methods and functions
3. WHEN generating tests THEN the system SHALL create test cases in the appropriate testing framework (pytest for Python, JUnit for Java, Jest for JavaScript)
4. WHEN test generation is complete THEN the system SHALL return the generated test cases in a structured format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to detect edge conditions and performance risks in my code, so that I can create robust tests that catch potential issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing code THEN the system SHALL identify potential edge cases including null/undefined values, empty collections, boundary conditions, and type mismatches
2. WHEN detecting loops or recursive functions THEN the system SHALL generate performance-related test cases
3. WHEN identifying error-prone patterns THEN the system SHALL create test cases that verify proper error handling
4. WHEN edge conditions are detected THEN the system SHALL generate specific test cases targeting those conditions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive integration test cases, so that I can verify how different components of my code work together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code contains multiple interacting classes or modules THEN the system SHALL generate integration test cases
2. WHEN external dependencies are detected THEN the system SHALL create test cases with appropriate mocking strategies
3. WHEN database or API interactions are present THEN the system SHALL generate integration tests with mock data
4. WHEN integration tests are generated THEN the system SHALL include setup and teardown procedures

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see coverage reports for the generated tests, so that I can understand what parts of my code are being tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test cases are generated THEN the system SHALL provide an estimated coverage report
2. WHEN coverage analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL identify untested code paths
3. WHEN coverage gaps are found THEN the system SHALL suggest additional test cases to improve coverage
4. WHEN displaying coverage THEN the system SHALL show line-by-line coverage information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to explain how it interprets my code flow and logic, so that I can understand the reasoning behind the generated tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing code THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of the identified code structure and flow
2. WHEN generating tests THEN the system SHALL explain the logic behind each test case
3. WHEN edge cases are detected THEN the system SHALL describe why specific conditions were identified as risky
4. WHEN presenting results THEN the system SHALL include reasoning for test case priorities and importance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to interact conversationally with the system to refine test cases, so that I can customize the generated tests to my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test cases are presented THEN the user SHALL be able to request modifications through natural language
2. WHEN a user requests changes THEN the system SHALL update the relevant test cases accordingly
3. WHEN refinements are made THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency across all related test cases
4. WHEN conversational interaction occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve the context of previous exchanges

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want to integrate the system with CI tools like GitHub Actions, so that test suggestions are automatically provided on pull requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is created THEN the system SHALL automatically analyze the changed code
2. WHEN code changes are detected THEN the system SHALL generate relevant test suggestions
3. WHEN integration is active THEN the system SHALL post test recommendations as PR comments
4. WHEN CI integration is configured THEN the system SHALL respect repository-specific testing conventions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle multiple programming languages consistently, so that I can use the same tool across different projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Python code is submitted THEN the system SHALL generate pytest-compatible test cases
2. WHEN Java code is submitted THEN the system SHALL generate JUnit-compatible test cases
3. WHEN JavaScript code is submitted THEN the system SHALL generate Jest-compatible test cases
4. WHEN switching between languages THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent analysis quality and depth
